Holmes 212-902-3580 Net Revenues Investment Banking Net revenues in Investment Banking were $823 million, 30% lower than the first quarter of 2008 and 20% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. Net revenues in Financial Advisory were $527 million, 21% lower than the first quarter of 2008, reflecting lower levels of deal activity. Net revenues in the firm's Underwriting business were $296 million, 42% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Net revenues in equity underwriting were significantly lower, primarily reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide equity and equity-related offerings. Net revenues in debt underwriting were also significantly lower, primarily due to a decline in leveraged finance activity. The firm's investment banking transaction backlog decreased from the end of fiscal year 2008. (5) Trading and Principal Investments Net revenues in Trading and Principal Investments were $7.15 billion, compared with net revenues of $5.12 billion for the first quarter of 2008 and negative net revenues of $4.36 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008. Net revenues in FICC were $6.56 billion, more than double the amount in the first quarter of 2008. These results reflected particularly strong performance in interest rate products, commodities and credit products, as FICC operated in a generally favorable environment characterized by client-driven activity, particularly in more liquid products, and high levels of volatility. However, illiquid assets generally continued to decline in value. Net revenues in currencies were solid, but lower compared with a particularly strong first quarter of 2008. Results in mortgages were higher compared with a difficult first quarter of 2008. During the quarter, credit products included losses from corporate debt and private equity investments, and mortgages included a loss of approximately $800 million (excluding hedges) on commercial mortgage loans and securities. In the first quarter of 2008, credit products included a loss of approximately $1 billion, net of hedges, related to non-investment-grade credit origination activities, and mortgages included a net loss of approximately $1 billion on residential mortgage loans and securities. Net revenues in Equities were $2.00 billion, 20% lower than the first quarter of 2008. Net revenues in the shares business were lower compared with the first quarter of 2008 due to lower commissions, primarily reflecting lower levels of activity outside of the U.S. Net revenues in derivatives were solid, but lower compared with the first quarter of 2008. Results in principal strategies were also lower compared with the first quarter of 2008. During the quarter, Equities operated in an environment generally characterized by continued weakness in global equity markets and high, but declining, levels of volatility. Principal Investments recorded a net loss of $1.41 billion for the first quarter of 2009. These results included net losses of $640 million from real estate principal investments and $621 million from corporate principal investments, as well as a $151 million loss related to the firm's investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC). 2 Asset Management and Securities Services Net revenues in Asset Management and Securities Services were $1.45 billion, 29% lower than the first quarter of 2008 and 17% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. Asset Management net revenues were $949 million, 28% lower than the first quarter of 2008, due to lower management and other fees, reflecting lower assets under management, principally due to market depreciation, and lower incentive fees. During the quarter, assets under management decreased $27 billion to $771 billion (6), due to $16 billion of market depreciation, primarily in equity assets, and $11 billion of net outflows. Securities Services net revenues were $503 million, 30% lower than the first quarter of 2008. The decrease in net revenues primarily reflected the impact of lower customer balances compared with the first quarter of 2008. Expenses Operating expenses were $6.80 billion, 10% higher than the first quarter of 2008. Compensation and Benefits Compensation and benefits expenses (including salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of prior year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes, severance costs and benefits) were $4.71 billion, 18% higher than the first quarter of 2008, primarily due to higher net revenues. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues was 50.0%, compared with 48.0% for the first quarter of 2008. Employment levels decreased 7% compared with the end of fiscal year 2008. Non-Compensation Expenses Non-compensation expenses, excluding consolidated entities held for investment purposes (7), were $1.62 billion, 21% lower than the first quarter of 2008 and 25% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. More than one-half of the decrease compared with the first quarter of 2008 was attributable to lower brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees, principally reflecting lower transaction volumes in Equities. The remainder of the decrease compared with the first quarter of 2008 generally reflected lower levels of business activity, the impact of reduced employment levels and the effect of expense reduction initiatives. The increase in non-compensation expenses related to consolidated entities held for investment purposes primarily reflected impairment charges of approximately $300 million related to real estate assets during the first quarter of 2009. Including consolidated entities held for investment purposes, non-compensation expenses were $2.08 billion, 5% lower than the first quarter of 2008 and 17% lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. Provision for Taxes The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2009 was 31.0%, up from approximately 1% for fiscal year 2008 and 29.5% for the first quarter of 2008. The increases in the effective tax rate were primarily due to changes in geographic earnings mix. 3 Capital As of March 27, 2009, total capital was $252.08 billion, consisting of $63.55 billion in total shareholders' equity (common shareholders' equity of $47.05 billion and preferred stock of $16.51 billion) and $188.53 billion in unsecured long-term borrowings.

These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. Such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that the firm actually earns from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval.
