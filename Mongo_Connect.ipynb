Not even in the strip mall I used to hit in Hudson on my dry cleaning route back in the day. There was a deli, but it opened at fucking 11! Who even wants to go to a deli after 11? Weak. Breezed through Peninsula. Winking Lizard? Bah. Ended up backtracking through Brecksville and I remembered an old friend. London Pickle Works! Was it still there some four years after I stopped in while house shopping? Yup. Incidentally, investing in a condo down there probably would have made more sense than buying a house in Lakewood. Live and learn.\\n\\nCozied up to the bar and ordered a Killians, plus cheesesteak to go(for pooch). Like the Unicorn, food was amazingly done before I could chug my brew. I could get used to this kind of service. The bar was all old men. Matt, I don't know how you do it. They were watching Fox news for chrissakes!! Total was eight dollars! Holy shit. I dropped a three dollar tip on that barmaid's ass. How could I not? A real meal at fast food prices, at fast food speed, served by someone not under house arrest with work privileges. Busted open the styro box. Big sandwich with mushrooms, onions, cheez and beef sliced so thin I swear it was a Steak'um. I never ate those as a kid, but I remember one time my friend had one in his bedroom where we were playing NES. He didn't want it, so we threw it all around the room. Fries were awesome. Also got a pickle. That's eight dollars with the beer, just to recap. Great value, nice location, old men. I won't wait four more years to come back.\",\n",

       "  u'text': u'This place used to be Five Points Deli & Restaurant, I don\\'t know if it was an ownership change or just a name change.  I\\'m not considering this a full review, since we just stopped in here for dessert and coffee.  I\\'ll have to come back for an actual MEAL, and do more of a review then.\\n\\n3 of us ordered desserts (2 slices of cake, one of the apple pie).  Received ginormous portions (especially of the cake, 3 of us could split one slice of that).  Everything was tasty, but not made on-premises (I actually think I saw packaging from Sam\\'s in the dessert case on the way out).  Decent value for the money.  This area doesn\\'t have many options if you\\'ve got the taste for dessert (other than ice cream) and don\\'t want to whip up some brownies.\\n\\nFood I saw on other tables all looked pretty good.  Pleasant server, decent \"diner-style\" ambiance.  Pretty extensive menu, especially for breakfast.  Spotless bathroom.\\n\\nI\\'ll have to swing by here soon.  I think the Corned Beef Hash is calling out to me!',\n",

       "  u'text': u\"Stopped in here Mother's Day for breakfast because every other place was packed. Don't usually come here for the same reasons mentioned in other reviews about service, cleanliness, etc. Again, got the same put out attitude from the servers and slimy table top near the kitchen. The big thing that got me this time was as the wife and I sat there waiting for our food, one of the bus boys who was apparently on his break and looked to be one of the owners relatives, reached over our table to grab some ketchup to put on HIS plate of eggs! He was in clear view and in the way of the service traffic. Nobody that worked there said a word to this oaf as he chowed down! We just looked at each other and laughed in disbelieve! Good thing we don't use ketchup on our eggs! The funniest thing was after we got our food the the tide of people that came in behind us must have overwhelmed them! The staff looked horrified like they didn't expect this much overflow on Mother's Day or capable of handling it! Only got one refill of coffee in this panicked frenzy of pisses off staff and patrons! As we left the owner took our money with a smile as if he was oblivious to the chaos going on behind him! Wow! Last time, no more!\",\n",

After a quick visit to the clean restroom, we were greeted and seated immediately.  Three menus appeared...  Daily specials, breakfast menu, and the full menu.  We chose to go to the dinner route.  Our waitress could not have been more helpful.  On her recommendation, we both chose the fried chicken dinner.  It was crunchy, slightly sweet, and oh so good!  It came with potato, rolls, corn, and either soup or salad.  I had the Italian wedding soup which was delicious.... Not heavy on celery taste, although clearly there was celery added.  Dinner comes with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, if you like.  We felt lucky to find this place.  Our waitress was so attentive, never missing a beat.  If we lived closer, we would definitely be back!',\n",

But the second trip -- had the fried cod dinner again, and there was something N-O-T Q-U-I-T-E R-I-G-H-T about it, tartar sauce wasn't even fully mixed, in place of the corn I had mixed (ugh!) veggies, french fries almost soggy, rice pudding had a liberal dose of cinnamon but it was still thin and tasteless, owner too busy on a personal phone call to say hello.  The good news -- our server was excellent, the kitchen got orders out quickly again, the rest rooms still clean, the dining room still neat and orderly.  the lentil soup was still quite good.

       "  u'text': u'Someone recommended Luna\\'s and so earlier today I thought I would give it a try for dinner.  Well, not a good decision.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the menu I decided to try something \\'safe\\' so I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The meat loaf had very little seasoning, if any.  It had an odd taste.  It also appeared to be overcooked around the edges.  There was quite a \\'crust\\' on it.  Overall, not appetizing at all.  The \\'mashed\\' potatoes were quite lumpy.  I had to finish mashing them with the fork.  It appeared they had been mashed quickly, possibly just before they were served.  Again, lack of seasoning, particularly salt.  Not good at all.   I didn\\'t finish either item.\\n\\nAnd when I tried to pay my check, there was no one at the register.  I probably stood there about 3 minutes before another customer got in line behind me.  She finally summoned a waiter and asked if we could pay our bills.  The response was, \"I don\\'t know where she is.\"  He then disappeared for a moment and then returned and said \"She will be with you in a minute.\"   Not good customer service.\\n\\nThe whole meal was not very good.  While the price was reasonable, the food didn\\'t live up to the hype that I received.  I don\\'t think I would either recommend this place or go there again.  There are better places with food that is more appetizing.   A real disappointment for sure.',\n",

I asked for a booth. I was seated and the server, asked, what can i get you to drink. I ordered my drink and the server left. As I am drinking my pop, the server finally brings me the menu and leaves again. As I am looking at the menu I noticed there were family members of the owner/manager (maybe), helping out in which I thought was cute? But kind of weird! I thought that it was sweet that a family business was helped by togetherness of family members. As I am waiting for the server to return  to take my order I noticed that some of the tables were dirty and the floor was sticky. It seemed  that the tables were not properly wiped off. The server finally came back to take my order, i ordered the corn beef and fries instead of cabbage  and a salad with oil and vinegar then hums as an appetizer. I sat and waited for my order for about 15-20 minutes. The owner/manager was walking around helping out his family members. That's a good owner/manager helping out. The server brought out the salad with the dressings. I notice that the dressing  bottle was very dirty, The rest of the food came out all at once instead of the appetizer first. The hummus did not taste like hummus. The hummus was very tasteless. The corn beef was bland and the carrots tasted like  they came from a can from the store. The fries tasted as if they were prefrozened  and prepared from a bag instead of fresh. After looking at the dessert i remember seeing the brand of cake sold at walmart... not fresh.\",\n",

When I say rushing I mean like every minute or so.   Seriously. \\n\\nThe Chicken Noodle Soup looked like glorified boxed soup.  The salad had lettuce that was starting to rust.  Someone must really like onions because there were 7 large slices of red onion on it.  But, here is the best part was the dressing came in a squeeze package like the ones at fast food places.  The meatloaf was horrible but strangely the mashed potatoes were good.  The fried chicken was OK. They make it with honey so chicken is very sweet and not something I'd eat again.  The fries were typical frozen french fries but were OK.  \\n\\nIf the food wasn't disappointing enough, all of the servers had bad attitudes and it showed.  We could hear all the talk from the kitchen since we were so close.  It is obvious no one wants to be there.  They don't care about the quality of their food or service.
