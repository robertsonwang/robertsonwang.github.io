    "As an example, we're going to create a single document summarization for AIG's 2009 first quarter earnings announcement. The full text of the announcement can be found __[here](http://www.aig.com/content/dam/aig/america-canada/us/documents/investor-relations/1q09-press-release-report.pdf)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, most of the pertinent information is concentrated in the first 10 pages of the document. Digging deeper, the main hightlights can be found in the first paragraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote> \n",
    "American International Group, Inc. (AIG) today reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2009 of \\$4.35 billion or \\$1.98 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of \\$7.81 billion or \\$3.09 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. First quarter 2009 adjusted net loss, excluding net realized capital gains (losses) and FAS 133 gains (losses), net of tax, was \\$1.60 billion, compared to an adjusted net loss of \\$3.56 billion in the first quarter of 2008.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the headline numbers that most analysts and investors pay attention to, specifically it contains the earnings figure and a comparision with the previous quarters earnings. For that reason each of the below algorithms are designed to return the first sentence of the first paragraph for each earnings announcement. However, I do not show this in the results. A separate function call naively returns this sentence for each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional measure for summarization quality is called __[Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluatio (ROUGE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric))__ This metric basically looks at the overlap in orders (as defined by some N-Gram window) between the automatically generated summary and one that was created manually by a human.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicitys sake, I haven't generated a ROUGE score because we're only generating 6 key sentences for each of our documents. I start with the ideal summary and then move on to generating single document summaries using each of the three summarization algorithms."
